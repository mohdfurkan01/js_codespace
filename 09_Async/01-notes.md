# JavaScript

⏭Synchronous
⏭Single thread
JavaScript is a synchronous, single-threaded language. This means that it executes code line by line, one operation at a time, in a single thread.

The single-threaded nature of JavaScript implies that it can only do one task at a time. If one task is blocking, other tasks have to wait until it’s finished.
