    //Lexical scope is about accessing variables in the current scope chain during the function's execution.

    //Closures are created when an inner function continues to access variables from its parent scope even after the outer function has returned.
    //A closure gives the inner function access to its outer function’s variables even after the outer function has completed execution.

    //Closures are an essential part of JavaScript’s nature and help in creating data privacy and handling asynchronous tasks effectively.

    function outer() {
      let username = "ahsan";
      function inner() {
        let secret = "money123";
        console.log(username); //accessable
      }
      function innerTwo() {
        console.log(username); //accessable
        //console.log(secret); //not accessble
      }
      inner();
      innerTwo();
    }
    outer();
    //console.log(username); not accessable out of scope

    // a child can access their parent's properties but the parent can not access their child's properties and also child2 can not access child1's properties means brother can not share their money.
    //example
    function parent() {
      let baap_ka_paisa = "sufficient"; // accessible by child1 and child2
      function child1() {
        let secret = "money123"; // local to child1
        console.log("for child1", baap_ka_paisa); //accessable
      }
      function child2() {
        console.log("for child2", baap_ka_paisa); //accessable
        //console.log(secret); //not accessble, secret is local to child1
      }
      child1();
      child2();
    }
    parent();
    //Parent's properties (baap_ka_paisa) are accessible to both children (child1 and child2) because they’re defined in the parent function’s scope.

    //Child-specific properties (secret) are not shared between sibling functions. Child1’s variable secret is not accessible to Child2, and vice versa.
