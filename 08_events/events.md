  />
</li>;

document.getElementById("vscodeimg").addEventListener("keydown", function (e) {
  console.log("Key down:", e.key);
});
// press the letter 'A', it will show 'Key down: A' in the console.
//tabindex="0" makes the image element focusable by keyboard or mouse click. By default, images are not focusable, so they cannot receive keydown events.
